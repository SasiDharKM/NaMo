# Make NaMo
My game on the lines of Gabriele Cirulli's [original 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). 



## Donations
Gabriele made his game in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means he doesn't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`.
