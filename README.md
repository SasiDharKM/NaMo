# Make 2048
My version of Gabriele Cirulli's [original 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). 



## Donations
Gabriele made this in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means he doesn't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`.
